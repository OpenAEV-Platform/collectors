# OpenBAS NVD NIST CVE collector

The NVD NIST CVE collector is a standalone Python process that collects data from the NVD (National Vulnerability Database).

### CVE and CVSS base score V3.1

CVEs are assigned a criticality score (CVSS) making it possible to prioritize vulnerabilities and thus prioritize IS security projects.  
As of July 13th, 2022, the NVD will no longer generate new information for CVSS v2.  
Existing CVSS V2 information will remain in the database, but the NVD will no longer actively populate CVSS V2 for new CVEs.  
CVSS V3.1 was released in June 2019, thus most CVE published before 2019 do not include the `cvssMetricV31` object. The exception are CVE published before 2019 that were later reanalyzed or modified.  
These CVE may have been updated to include CVSS V3.1 information. If the CVE was updated in this way, the API response would include this optional information.

This collector **will import all CVE with CVSS V3.1 base score**.

## Requirements

- OpenBAS Platform version 1.19 or higher  
- An **API Key for accessing NVD** ‚Äì required to use the NVD CVE API.  
  üëâ You can request a free API key here: [https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)  
  Once you‚Äôve submitted the request form, your API key will be sent to your email address. Keep it safe and include it in your configuration (see below).

## Installation

Get a local copy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenBAS-Platform/collectors
cd ./collectors/nvd_nist_cve
````

Install the environment:
**Production**:

```bash
# production environment
poetry install --extras prod
```

**Development** (note that you should also clone the [pyobas](https://github.com/OpenBAS-Platform/client-python) repository [according to these instructions](../README.md#simultaneous-development-on-pyobas-and-a-collector)):

```bash
# development environment
poetry install --extras dev
```

## Usage

```bash
poetry run python -m nvd_nist_cve.openbas_nvd_nist_cve
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Important:** Without a valid API key, requests to the NVD API will fail or be rate-limited. Ensure your key is correctly set in either the `config.yml` file or the environment variable `NVD_NIST_CVE_API_KEY`.

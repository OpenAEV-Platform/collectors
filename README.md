The following repository is used to store the OpenBAS collectors for the platform integration with other tools and applications. To know how to enable collectors on OpenBAS, please read the [dedicated documentation](https://docs.openbas.io/latest/deployment/collectors).

## Collectors list and statuses

This repository is used to host connectors that are supported by the core development team of OpenBAS. Nevertheless, the community is also developing a lot of collectors, third-parties modules directly linked to OpenBAS. You can find the list of all available connectors and plugins in the [OpenBAS ecosystem dedicated space](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenBAS-Ecosystem-30d8eb73d7d04611843e758ddef8941b).

If you want to make your collectors available to the community, **please create a Pull Request on this repository**, then we will integrate it to the CI and in the [OpenBAS ecosystem](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenBAS-Ecosystem-30d8eb73d7d04611843e758ddef8941b).
